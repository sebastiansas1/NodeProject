/*
  -Model for a Review, outlining the database schema.
  -Each of the Review attributes is either a String, an Array of Strings, or an Number (Integer) 
  -Review images are stored as an Array of Strings, where each String is the path to the uploaded image,
  which is stored in Public/Uploads. These images are therefore global, and can be viewed by all users. 
  -To create a review, a user must first Register for an account and Log In (see User model)
